##A Warning

Note that this project, at the current moment, makes a hell of a lot of assumptions about the structure of Mixpanel, and in the current commit, attempts to search for an event specific to a different, equally specific product. 

Until I can remove these implicit assumptions, feel free to fork and use as needed.

##Building
To build, simply run the build script (`./build.sh`). Required Swift version is 3.0.1, macOS 10.11 or higher.
